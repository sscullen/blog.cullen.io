Generally I develop web apps using Python (Django, DRF) and Javascript (Typescript, React). I'm interested in doing more with realtime data sources such as Firebase and GraphQL subscriptions. I'm also interested in building dynamic applications with websockets. Mostly I work in the geospatial domain, but my interest in development can be applied to any problem that needs creative solutions.

In addition to development, I enjoy solving real world problems using various tools, including 3D printing, wood working, sensors, and electronics like Arduino. I really enjoy ideas becoming realities, whether in software development or in making things. Projects that involve software and hardware are my favorite things to work on.
